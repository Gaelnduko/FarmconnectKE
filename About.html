    <h1>FarmconnectKE</h1>
    <p>
      FarmconnectKE is a digital platform connecting local farmers directly with
      consumers and businesses, promoting fair trade, fresh produce, and
      sustainable agriculture in Kenya.
    </p>
    <h1>Core Idea</h1>
    <p>
      FarmConnectKE aims to bridge the gap between farmers who struggle to find
      reliable markets and consumers who want affordable, fresh produce. It’s a
      web-based marketplace that uses simple, accessible technology (HTML, CSS,
      JS, Tailwind) to make agricultural trade transparent, local, and
      efficient. Think of it as “Jumia for farm produce,” but focused on local
      farmers and community-driven growth
